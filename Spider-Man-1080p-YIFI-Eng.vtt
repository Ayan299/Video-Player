WEBVTT

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.460
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.920
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:17.715
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.385
...if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.345
...somebody lied.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.810
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.400
...is all about a girl.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.730
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.985
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.820
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.990
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.911
Hey! Stop the bus!

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:50.080
That's me.

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.165
Tell him to stop! Please!

00:03:52.374 --> 00:03:53.583
Stop!

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.003
Hey! Stop the bus!

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.256
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:00.674
Catch a cab, Parker!

00:04:05.137 --> 00:04:07.931
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.646
What a geek!

00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:19.526
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.278
Would you date him?

00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:41.381
Midtown High seniors.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:45.260
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:49.014
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.643
We are guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:55.062
So behave accordingly.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.273
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

00:04:58.482 --> 00:05:00.108
Come on people, let's stay together.

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:03.195
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:07.407
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:10.118
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.707
- You know Charles, can you drive around the corner please?
- Why?

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.709
The entrance is right there.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:21.588
Dad, these are the public school kids.
I'm not showing up to a field trip, in a Rolls.

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:24.132
What? You want me to trade my car in for a Jetta...

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:27.094
...just because you flunked out every
of private school I ever sent you to?

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:30.430
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:35.435
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:36.937
It's just...

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.563
Just what, Harry?

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.274
Forget it...

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:44.611
Pete!

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:47.531
- Hi ya, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:50.617
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:55.539
- Peter, may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:59.209
- It's a great honor to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.296
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.632
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.844
- And you understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:12.347
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:17.060
- Well, I live with my aunt and uncle. They are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

00:06:17.227 --> 00:06:20.897
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.737
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Yea..not if you're a genius.

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:28.864
I think he wants to adopt you.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:33.744
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:37.748
They're in the order Araneae,
which is divided into three suborders.

00:06:37.956 --> 00:06:39.041
Wow! That's amazing!

00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:43.128
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern seaboard.

00:06:43.462 --> 00:06:45.505
- It's unreal.
- Wow...

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:48.467
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:52.179
...varying strengths which help
them in their constant search for food.

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:56.600
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

00:06:56.767 --> 00:07:00.938
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:02.856
- For the school paper?

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:12.366
Next, we have the Net Web spider,
family Filistatidae...

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:14.451
...genus Kukulcania.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:19.039
It spins an intricate funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:24.503
...proportionately equal to
the type of high-tension wires used in bridge building.

00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:26.630
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

00:07:26.797 --> 00:07:29.800
Or his father will fire your father.

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:32.552
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.222
What is going on?

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.475
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:40.686
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

00:07:40.852 --> 00:07:45.023
...hunts using a set of reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:48.735
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:51.071
- An early awareness of danger.
- Those guys are jerks.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.031
A spider-sense.

00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:55.325
Hey, look at that spider.

00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:59.913
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:02.082
It's a defense mechanism.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:05.544
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:06.920
Who wouldn't?

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:10.924
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility...

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:15.470
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.434
Armed with these DNA blueprints, we have now
begun what was once thought impossible.

00:08:20.642 --> 00:08:24.313
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:25.897
I love them!

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.108
Yeah, me too.

00:08:29.067 --> 00:08:32.946
You know, spiders can change
their color...

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:36.950
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:41.246
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.833
- transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.128
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:52.966
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.635
There's 14.

00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:56.470
I beg your pardon?

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:59.181
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.728
Huh..I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:09.942
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the Eastern seaboard?

00:09:10.108 --> 00:09:14.196
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:16.114
Let's go talk about how we listen.

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:24.289
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools Oswald...

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:26.375
...but at Midtown High...

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:38.595
Hey..Uh..Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:40.222
- Sure! Yea.
- Great.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.724
Where do you want me?
Over here?

00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:44.268
Yeah, yeah..that's great.

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:46.353
Don't make me look ugly.

00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:48.563
That's impossible.

00:09:55.821 --> 00:09:57.072
Perfect.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.373
- Is that good?
- Great.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.297
That's great.

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:20.887
M.J., let's go!

00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:25.017
Wait..Thanks!

00:10:38.488 --> 00:10:41.241
Parker, let's do it.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:01.428
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:04.139
I've already seen the glider.

00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:06.600
That's not what I'm here for.

00:11:06.808 --> 00:11:09.478
General Slocum, good to see you again.

00:11:10.312 --> 00:11:12.481
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:14.566
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:18.278
Always a pleasure to have our board
of directors pay us a little visit.

00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:21.907
I want the progress report on human
performance enhancers.

00:11:22.074 --> 00:11:26.578
We tried vapor inhalation with rodent subjects.
They showed an 800% increase in strength.

00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:28.622
- 800%? That's excellent.
- Any side effects?

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:29.873
- In one trial..yes.
- It was an aberration..

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.709
All the tests since then,
have been successful.

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:36.630
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened? What were the side effects?

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:39.132
Violence, aggression...

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.051
...and insanity.

00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:43.971
- And what do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:48.058
With the exception of Dr. Stromm,
our entire staff certifies the product...

00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:51.144
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:56.149
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:59.820
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:02.823
I'm going to be frank with you.

00:12:03.073 --> 00:12:07.911
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:10.831
Norman, The General gave the go ahead to
Quest Aerospace...

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:13.917
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:18.171
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers..

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:22.426
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:27.055
...I'm going to pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.517
Gentlemen. Ladies.

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:41.028
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

00:12:41.278 --> 00:12:43.363
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:48.368
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:51.121
I'm already on my ass, May.

00:12:51.288 --> 00:12:55.792
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.670
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.214
Hand me that dish. The green one.

00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:04.217
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:06.553
...and upsizing their profits.

00:13:06.803 --> 00:13:09.723
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:13.644
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.564
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.358
Computer...

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:23.320
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

00:13:23.487 --> 00:13:27.240
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:32.829
May..I'm 68 years old. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:35.916
I love you. And Peter loves you.

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:39.419
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.091
- We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
- Yeah...

00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:49.513
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:52.265
Hey! How you doing buddy? How was the field trip?

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:55.269
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:57.938
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.524
Well di.did..did you get some pictures, Peter?

00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:04.194
Uh..I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:07.197
What's that all about?

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:30.679
In this recombination lab...

00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:35.475
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.729
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:43.734
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:02.169
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:05.672
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:09.509
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:11.887
Don't be a coward.

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.931
Risks are part of laboratory science.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.852
Let me reschedule,
with proper medical staff and a volunteer.

00:15:19.061 --> 00:15:21.521
- If you just give me two weeks..
- Two weeks? Two weeks!

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:26.193
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.112
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.949
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:35.869
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:40.457
40,000 years of evolution...

00:15:40.624 --> 00:15:44.378
...and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

00:15:58.225 --> 00:15:59.559
Oh, that's cold.

00:16:58.035 --> 00:16:59.286
Norman?

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.083
Norman!

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:17.137
Oh, my God.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:20.057
Oh, my God!

00:17:22.726 --> 00:17:24.561
Oh, my God! Norman! Norman!

00:17:40.953 --> 00:17:42.579
Back to formula?

00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:18.699
Weird.

00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:31.003
- Peter?
- Yeah?

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:32.963
Are you all right?

00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:36.508
Uh..I'm fine.

00:18:37.092 --> 00:18:40.470
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:43.390
Yep. Big change.

00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:47.561
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.

00:19:05.954 --> 00:19:07.331
Okay?!

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:15.839
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:17.716
- I got better.
- You See?

00:19:17.883 --> 00:19:21.261
- Bye, guys.
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?

00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:25.098
- Yeah I've got it.
- Hey Michaelangelo, don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:28.060
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.354
And don't start up with me.

00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:35.609
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

00:19:36.568 --> 00:19:40.280
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash just like her!

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:44.034
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

00:20:01.426 --> 00:20:03.095
Hi, M.J.

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:05.472
Hey, M.J.

00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:10.269
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:13.772
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:15.274
I got the car. Hop in.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.318
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

00:20:18.527 --> 00:20:22.364
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

00:20:22.614 --> 00:20:23.865
Or not.

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.040
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:36.128
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:38.171
Tell him to stop.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.841
- Check him out!
- Dork!

00:21:03.322 --> 00:21:04.573
Dad!

00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:06.908
Dad, are you all right?

00:21:07.743 --> 00:21:09.036
Harry.

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:14.374
What are you doing on the floor?

00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:15.876
I don't know.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.046
Have you been there all night?

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:22.299
Last night I was...

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:25.886
What?

00:21:27.137 --> 00:21:29.556
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

00:21:29.765 --> 00:21:31.433
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.938
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

00:21:36.104 --> 00:21:37.147
What?

00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:40.901
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

00:21:41.068 --> 00:21:44.446
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:46.615
- What about it?
- Its been stolen, sir.

00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:14.309
Wow! Great reflexes!

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:17.354
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:22.359
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.778
You just get contacts?

00:22:31.535 --> 00:22:33.704
Well, see you.

00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:18.999
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:20.834
Did you see that?

00:23:22.419 --> 00:23:24.087
Parker?

00:23:55.953 --> 00:23:58.372
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny don't you, freak?

00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:01.541
- Flash, it was an accident.
- My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.461
- C'mon Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you Flash.

00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:08.048
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

00:24:26.942 --> 00:24:28.277
Help him, Harry.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.741
How'd he do that?

00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:37.077
Which one?

00:24:37.244 --> 00:24:38.620
He's all yours, man.

00:24:54.136 --> 00:24:55.846
Flash, get up!

00:24:57.472 --> 00:25:00.601
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:04.021
That was amazing.

00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:06.940
I'm out of here. Come on.

00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:53.171
Go, web!

00:26:54.756 --> 00:26:56.383
Fly.

00:26:57.968 --> 00:27:00.053
Up, up and away, web.

00:27:01.638 --> 00:27:03.056
Shazam!

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.891
Go! Go!

00:27:05.142 --> 00:27:06.893
Go, web, go!

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.762
Tallyho.

00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:28.266
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

00:28:28.475 --> 00:28:29.726
Bring me some beer.

00:28:29.935 --> 00:28:32.479
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

00:28:32.646 --> 00:28:34.147
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

00:28:34.314 --> 00:28:36.650
You're as stupid as your mother.

00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:41.113
Where's she going?
Where you going?

00:28:42.197 --> 00:28:45.534
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

00:28:45.742 --> 00:28:49.037
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

00:28:49.246 --> 00:28:53.375
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

00:28:53.583 --> 00:28:56.086
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.673
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.592
I guess you can always hear us.

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:05.053
Everybody shouts.

00:29:05.512 --> 00:29:07.639
Your aunt and uncle don't.

00:29:07.806 --> 00:29:10.350
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

00:29:11.768 --> 00:29:15.981
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:17.858
You really freaked us out.

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:20.319
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:24.573
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:30.871
So where are you going
after you graduate?

00:29:35.626 --> 00:29:37.919
I wanna move into the city.

00:29:38.837 --> 00:29:43.634
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.637
Work my way through college.

00:29:47.638 --> 00:29:48.972
What about you?

00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:51.141
Headed for the city too.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.102
Can't wait to get out of here.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.772
I wanna...

00:29:58.023 --> 00:29:59.524
What?

00:30:02.361 --> 00:30:04.613
No, come on. Try me.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.032
I wanna...

00:30:08.158 --> 00:30:09.493
...act...

00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:12.162
...on-stage.

00:30:12.746 --> 00:30:14.581
Really?

00:30:14.957 --> 00:30:17.125
Oh, that's perfect.

00:30:17.417 --> 00:30:19.962
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

00:30:20.295 --> 00:30:22.130
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:30:22.756 --> 00:30:25.759
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:28.470
Peter, that was first grade.

00:30:28.971 --> 00:30:30.472
Well...

00:30:31.014 --> 00:30:32.516
...even so.

00:30:33.517 --> 00:30:35.435
Sometimes...

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.938
...you know people.

00:30:39.106 --> 00:30:42.693
You can just see what's coming.

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:48.532
What do you see coming for you?

00:30:51.118 --> 00:30:52.786
I don't know.

00:30:55.122 --> 00:30:59.793
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.300
And what for me?

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:07.801
For you?

00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:11.972
You're gonna light up Broadway.

00:31:13.473 --> 00:31:14.808
You know...

00:31:19.187 --> 00:31:21.815
...you're taller than you look.

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.525
I hunch.

00:31:25.777 --> 00:31:27.279
Don't.

00:31:30.824 --> 00:31:34.369
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:36.747
Come on.

00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:39.166
I gotta go.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.168
Bye.

00:31:41.835 --> 00:31:44.504
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:46.673
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.092
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

00:31:49.343 --> 00:31:50.927
Pretty tight, huh?

00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:55.682
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

00:31:57.434 --> 00:31:58.685
Cool car.

00:33:31.403 --> 00:33:33.447
What's going on in there?

00:33:33.655 --> 00:33:36.283
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.120
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

00:33:40.412 --> 00:33:42.497
Okay. Thanks.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.657
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me what it is.

00:34:16.823 --> 00:34:19.493
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:22.329
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.

00:34:22.746 --> 00:34:25.290
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

00:34:25.499 --> 00:34:28.877
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

00:34:29.044 --> 00:34:32.297
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.812
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute. We need to talk.

00:34:46.979 --> 00:34:51.358
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

00:34:52.234 --> 00:34:54.486
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

00:34:54.653 --> 00:34:58.699
Because we haven't talked for so long.
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are anymore.

00:34:58.865 --> 00:35:03.870
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

00:35:04.037 --> 00:35:08.166
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:11.336
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?

00:35:11.545 --> 00:35:14.548
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

00:35:14.715 --> 00:35:19.261
Pete look, you're changing. I know.
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.

00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:21.471
No. Not exactly.

00:35:22.848 --> 00:35:25.559
Peter..these are the years
when a man changes...

00:35:25.726 --> 00:35:29.730
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

00:35:29.896 --> 00:35:32.983
Just be careful who you change into.

00:35:34.526 --> 00:35:39.031
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

00:35:39.573 --> 00:35:42.284
But just because you can
beat him up...

00:35:42.743 --> 00:35:44.995
...doesn't give you the right to.

00:35:45.662 --> 00:35:50.917
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

00:35:51.501 --> 00:35:56.506
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some kind of criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

00:35:56.673 --> 00:36:00.093
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.

00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:04.598
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to preach.
And I know I'm not your father..

00:36:04.765 --> 00:36:07.601
Then stop pretending to be!

00:36:11.688 --> 00:36:12.940
Right..

00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.861
I'll pick you up here at 10.

00:36:49.101 --> 00:36:54.940
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

00:36:59.653 --> 00:37:03.699
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

00:37:07.828 --> 00:37:10.038
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:37:10.205 --> 00:37:14.751
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

00:37:17.838 --> 00:37:21.508
For $3000...

00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:25.304
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:30.183
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:34.855
Who?

00:37:35.105 --> 00:37:36.982
I know who.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:41.987
The Flying Dutchman!

00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:43.780
Next.

00:37:44.615 --> 00:37:47.909
There's no featherweight
division here small fry. Next.

00:37:48.076 --> 00:37:49.911
No, no. Sign me up.

00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:53.749
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

00:37:53.957 --> 00:37:58.128
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain while participating in said event

00:37:58.337 --> 00:38:01.465
- And you are indeed participating
of your own free will?
- Yes

00:38:01.632 --> 00:38:05.677
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

00:38:08.263 --> 00:38:10.515
Told you! Told you!

00:38:10.724 --> 00:38:12.517
Winner!

00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:13.936
Next victim!

00:38:15.812 --> 00:38:18.690
Are you ready for more?

00:38:19.816 --> 00:38:23.403
Bone Saw is ready!

00:38:25.822 --> 00:38:30.494
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

00:38:30.702 --> 00:38:35.415
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:40.045
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

00:38:40.921 --> 00:38:43.924
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

00:38:44.508 --> 00:38:46.885
The Human Spider? That's it? That's the best you got?

00:38:47.052 --> 00:38:49.179
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

00:38:49.346 --> 00:38:53.850
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

00:38:54.017 --> 00:38:57.271
...the terrifying, the deadly...

00:38:57.521 --> 00:39:00.732
...the amazing Spider-Man!

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.737
- My names "The Human Spider."
- I don't care, Get out there.

00:39:05.904 --> 00:39:08.949
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

00:39:11.451 --> 00:39:13.996
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

00:39:14.246 --> 00:39:16.290
I hope you brought your mommy.

00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:20.711
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

00:39:21.253 --> 00:39:26.383
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:28.927
Oh, my God!

00:39:29.136 --> 00:39:30.762
Oh, my legs!

00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:33.557
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

00:39:33.724 --> 00:39:35.726
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:39:43.984 --> 00:39:45.485
Cage! Cage! Cage!

00:39:45.652 --> 00:39:46.862
Cage!

00:39:56.204 --> 00:39:57.664
Hello? Guys?

00:39:58.707 --> 00:40:03.670
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

00:40:04.379 --> 00:40:08.675
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

00:40:09.843 --> 00:40:12.346
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

00:40:12.554 --> 00:40:14.348
Hey, freak show!

00:40:14.556 --> 00:40:17.184
You're going nowhere.

00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:19.728
I got you for three minutes.

00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:22.189
Three minutes of playtime.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.282
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:36.536
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:43.752
Finish him off!

00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.469
Smash him!

00:40:59.643 --> 00:41:01.395
- Hit him!
- Harder!

00:41:03.397 --> 00:41:05.732
Kick his spider ass!

00:41:07.734 --> 00:41:08.902
Hit him!

00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:24.126
One, two, three!

00:41:24.334 --> 00:41:27.129
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:32.384
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

00:41:49.776 --> 00:41:51.445
Now get out of here.

00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:55.907
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:58.493
Well, check it again, webhead.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.539
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

00:42:02.748 --> 00:42:06.126
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

00:42:06.293 --> 00:42:07.669
I need that money.

00:42:08.128 --> 00:42:11.214
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:22.643
- Hey, what the hell..?
- Put the money in the bag.

00:42:24.478 --> 00:42:25.812
Hurry up!

00:42:32.152 --> 00:42:34.237
Hey! He stole the gate!

00:42:34.404 --> 00:42:36.365
Stop that guy!

00:42:36.657 --> 00:42:39.201
Stop him! He's got my money!

00:42:39.409 --> 00:42:40.661
Thanks.

00:42:41.912 --> 00:42:44.289
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

00:42:44.456 --> 00:42:46.708
Cut him off and call the cops!

00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:50.921
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

00:42:51.088 --> 00:42:54.466
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

00:43:12.859 --> 00:43:15.779
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.407
Old dude, man.

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:22.786
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

00:43:22.953 --> 00:43:25.789
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:31.378
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

00:43:31.878 --> 00:43:33.714
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

00:43:35.882 --> 00:43:38.510
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

00:43:38.635 --> 00:43:42.180
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:43.765
Uncle Ben?

00:43:44.683 --> 00:43:46.184
Uncle Ben.

00:43:49.938 --> 00:43:51.273
Uncle Ben?

00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:56.403
Peter.

00:43:57.279 --> 00:43:59.072
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

00:44:04.703 --> 00:44:05.912
Peter.

00:44:27.893 --> 00:44:30.938
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

00:44:31.146 --> 00:44:35.859
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:14.893
Get a unit to the rear!

00:47:17.938 --> 00:47:19.481
I got the back!

00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:33.745
Who's there?

00:48:00.022 --> 00:48:03.150
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

00:48:03.317 --> 00:48:07.821
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

00:48:07.988 --> 00:48:09.489
Answer me!

00:48:12.826 --> 00:48:14.161
Stop that guy!

00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:21.335
Thanks.

00:48:31.219 --> 00:48:32.346
See you.

00:48:54.034 --> 00:48:57.496
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

00:49:39.997 --> 00:49:42.666
Oh, no. My God.

00:49:44.543 --> 00:49:48.255
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

00:49:56.596 --> 00:49:59.558
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:03.228
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocumm.

00:50:03.395 --> 00:50:08.817
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

00:50:09.526 --> 00:50:13.071
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test?

00:50:13.238 --> 00:50:15.532
Absolutely. Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

00:50:16.283 --> 00:50:19.036
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

00:50:19.202 --> 00:50:23.123
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.

00:50:25.459 --> 00:50:28.503
Preflight complete. Mark.

00:50:32.633 --> 00:50:35.260
We are picking up an unidentified
object closing fast.

00:50:35.427 --> 00:50:36.511
What the hell is that?

00:50:36.678 --> 00:50:38.180
Can you see anything?

00:50:38.639 --> 00:50:40.015
Oh, my God!

00:50:50.317 --> 00:50:53.153
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

00:50:53.654 --> 00:50:55.530
Peter!

00:50:55.739 --> 00:51:00.285
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

00:51:00.452 --> 00:51:03.956
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.

00:51:04.122 --> 00:51:05.666
- Oh that's Great!
- You made it.

00:51:08.418 --> 00:51:11.755
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

00:51:13.173 --> 00:51:15.342
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

00:51:15.759 --> 00:51:18.345
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

00:51:18.762 --> 00:51:20.055
Yeah.

00:51:23.016 --> 00:51:26.395
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:29.815
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

00:51:30.023 --> 00:51:31.566
Commencement:

00:51:31.733 --> 00:51:35.862
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:41.368
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

00:51:42.244 --> 00:51:44.121
You know what? Whatever.

00:51:44.663 --> 00:51:46.123
Your loss.

00:51:46.832 --> 00:51:50.377
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:54.381
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.522
Can I fix you something?

00:52:10.689 --> 00:52:12.190
No, thanks.

00:52:56.944 --> 00:52:59.154
I missed him a lot today.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.241
I know.

00:53:04.993 --> 00:53:06.828
I miss him too.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.916
But he was there.

00:53:14.086 --> 00:53:19.299
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:24.513
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

00:53:26.264 --> 00:53:28.350
You loved him...

00:53:30.018 --> 00:53:32.271
...and he loved you.

00:53:33.146 --> 00:53:36.817
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

00:53:36.984 --> 00:53:40.445
How you were meant for great things.

00:53:40.988 --> 00:53:43.323
You won't disappoint him.

00:54:16.857 --> 00:54:21.028
With great power
comes great responsibility.

00:54:21.194 --> 00:54:24.406
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:35.667
Hurry up!

00:54:48.055 --> 00:54:51.808
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.

00:54:51.975 --> 00:54:55.187
They think he's human. They think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

00:54:59.274 --> 00:55:02.027
Bobby. Get a load of this!

00:55:05.197 --> 00:55:09.451
He throws up his hands, ropes come out,
and he climbs up them like a spider web.

00:55:09.743 --> 00:55:13.872
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

00:55:14.039 --> 00:55:16.667
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.

00:55:16.833 --> 00:55:19.586
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo

00:55:19.753 --> 00:55:21.797
He stinks and I don't like him.

00:55:22.506 --> 00:55:24.091
Don't move, lady!

00:55:32.182 --> 00:55:34.935
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

00:55:35.143 --> 00:55:37.271
Those tights and that tight little...

00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:40.774
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

00:55:40.983 --> 00:55:44.736
But we should all just give him
One big hug

00:55:44.945 --> 00:55:49.533
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:56.957
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

00:55:57.124 --> 00:56:01.128
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

00:56:01.169 --> 00:56:02.629
Mr. Jameson, your wife is on the line...
she needs to know if--

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.800
- Mr Jameson, there's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem, shut up.

00:56:06.967 --> 00:56:08.510
- Well?
- He's news.

00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:11.221
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.

00:56:11.388 --> 00:56:15.392
- He pulled six people off a subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.

00:56:15.559 --> 00:56:19.730
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that! He's fleeing the scene. What's that tell you?

00:56:19.896 --> 00:56:23.859
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!

00:56:24.026 --> 00:56:26.820
Then why the mask hrmm?
What's he got to hide?

00:56:26.987 --> 00:56:30.032
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.

00:56:30.198 --> 00:56:32.659
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,

00:56:32.826 --> 00:56:36.663
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:40.000
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

00:56:40.167 --> 00:56:41.376
Every copy.

00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:45.756
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.

00:56:45.922 --> 00:56:48.842
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.

00:56:49.009 --> 00:56:50.677
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!

00:56:50.844 --> 00:56:55.724
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.

00:56:55.891 --> 00:56:58.018
Aw, what is he, shy?

00:56:58.185 --> 00:57:02.189
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.

00:57:02.356 --> 00:57:05.776
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"

00:57:05.943 --> 00:57:09.404
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:23.293
Buzz off.

00:57:24.002 --> 00:57:26.964
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

00:57:28.674 --> 00:57:33.553
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?

00:57:34.054 --> 00:57:37.766
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?

00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:38.976
Yeah.

00:57:39.184 --> 00:57:43.063
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.398
That's great MJ.

00:57:44.982 --> 00:57:48.193
- You're doing it. Your living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.987
Your drawer was short $6!

00:57:50.153 --> 00:57:52.781
Next time that happens, I'm gonna
take it outta your cheque!

00:57:53.865 --> 00:57:57.661
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

00:57:57.869 --> 00:58:00.163
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:04.459
Well it better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:13.135
Some dream, huh?

00:58:14.011 --> 00:58:16.638
That's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

00:58:16.805 --> 00:58:19.599
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

00:58:20.017 --> 00:58:24.605
Aren't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

00:58:25.022 --> 00:58:26.607
Oh, yeah. Right.

00:58:26.857 --> 00:58:29.943
I..I..I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:34.531
- He'd think it was low or something.
- That's not low. You have a job.

00:58:34.865 --> 00:58:39.202
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

00:58:40.704 --> 00:58:42.623
No, I guess not.

00:58:47.628 --> 00:58:49.212
Thanks, Pete.

00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:52.549
We should catch up sometime.

00:58:56.762 --> 00:58:59.306
Let's get some lunch some evening.

00:59:00.557 --> 00:59:05.062
Uhh..well..I'll come by someday and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.981
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

00:59:08.148 --> 00:59:09.399
I won't.

00:59:11.568 --> 00:59:13.320
I won't tell Harry.

00:59:24.623 --> 00:59:27.084
Timing's perfect. Hey!

00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:30.587
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Hahaha

00:59:32.714 --> 00:59:35.425
Stormin Norman's making his weekly inspection.

00:59:36.218 --> 00:59:38.470
Spent half of it on the phone.

00:59:39.054 --> 00:59:43.767
Look, I am glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:45.894
Are you all right?

00:59:47.229 --> 00:59:51.775
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

00:59:53.068 --> 00:59:56.029
No..I uhh..I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

00:59:56.196 --> 00:59:57.739
You were late again?

00:59:58.365 --> 01:00:02.327
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

01:00:02.494 --> 01:00:03.745
Around.

01:00:03.912 --> 01:00:05.622
Peter Parker.

01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:08.458
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:11.712
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

01:00:12.087 --> 01:00:13.755
When do I get to meet her?

01:00:13.922 --> 01:00:17.217
- Dad!
- Well, sorry. Harry hasn't mentioned her.

01:00:20.095 --> 01:00:23.348
Hey Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

01:00:23.557 --> 01:00:26.393
Um Dad, maybe you can help him out.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.897
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:35.360
No, I couldn't accept it sir. I like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.

01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:37.195
I respect that.

01:00:37.904 --> 01:00:40.032
You want to make it on your own steam.

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:42.034
That's great.

01:00:42.909 --> 01:00:45.245
What other skills do you have Parker?

01:00:45.454 --> 01:00:47.581
I was thinking of something in photography.

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:51.793
Hello..

01:00:53.712 --> 01:00:56.006
Let's go! Move it!

01:00:57.174 --> 01:00:58.842
Watch the street!

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:15.651
Cheese!

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:25.869
They're crap.

01:01:26.078 --> 01:01:29.039
Crap, crap. Mega crap.

01:01:29.247 --> 01:01:32.417
- I'll give you $200 bucks for all of them.
- That seems a little low..

01:01:32.626 --> 01:01:34.378
Take them somewhere else then.

01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:38.882
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

01:01:39.257 --> 01:01:41.218
Sit down. Give me that.

01:01:42.803 --> 01:01:45.347
I'll give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:47.849
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?

01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:51.353
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.648
- Menace? He was protecting that armor--
- Tell you what Atticus, you take the pictures

01:01:54.856 --> 01:01:57.526
...I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you?

01:01:57.693 --> 01:01:59.695
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

01:02:00.153 --> 01:02:03.657
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:06.910
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:08.745
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

01:02:08.954 --> 01:02:13.250
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:16.420
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

01:02:16.586 --> 01:02:20.882
I'll send you a box of Christmas meat.
Best I can do. Get outta here. Bring me more photos.

01:02:22.467 --> 01:02:23.677
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:23.885 --> 01:02:27.306
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:31.518
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.437
I'm Peter Parker.

01:02:35.939 --> 01:02:38.108
I'm a photographer.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.445
Yes..I can see that.

01:02:49.161 --> 01:02:50.996
As of today...

01:02:51.163 --> 01:02:55.167
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:59.838
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

01:03:00.005 --> 01:03:02.841
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

01:03:03.008 --> 01:03:06.178
...costs are down, revenues are up...

01:03:06.428 --> 01:03:09.264
...and our stock
has never been higher.

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:13.852
Wonderful news, Norman. Wonderful
In fact, it's the reason we're selling the company.

01:03:14.686 --> 01:03:15.938
What?

01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:21.276
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.

01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:24.279
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

01:03:24.446 --> 01:03:25.614
Why wasn't I told?

01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:29.868
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.454
The deal is off if you come with it.

01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:36.041
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

01:03:36.249 --> 01:03:38.210
You can't do this to me.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.674
I started this company.

01:03:44.716 --> 01:03:47.135
You know how much I sacrificed?!

01:03:50.973 --> 01:03:56.436
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

01:03:56.979 --> 01:04:00.983
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

01:04:01.149 --> 01:04:02.651
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:05.779
You're out, Norman.

01:04:15.664 --> 01:04:17.165
Am I?

01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:27.884
Welcome to OSCORP Industry's Unity Day Festival!
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

01:05:04.296 --> 01:05:07.841
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

01:05:08.884 --> 01:05:12.554
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:17.267
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:20.187
I think you're beautiful.

01:05:32.991 --> 01:05:36.244
M.J, would you do me a favor?
I forgot my drink inside. Come on..

01:05:46.463 --> 01:05:48.590
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

01:05:49.675 --> 01:05:54.846
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure..if he's coming today.

01:06:06.858 --> 01:06:09.361
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

01:06:14.241 --> 01:06:15.534
What is that?

01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:17.619
That's our glider!

01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:29.464
What the hell was that?

01:06:57.868 --> 01:06:59.286
Code three! Code three!!

01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:17.471
- Arghh!!! Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!!

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.897
Harry! Help me! Harry!

01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:34.613
Hahaha! Out, am I?

01:07:39.159 --> 01:07:42.371
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

01:07:44.373 --> 01:07:46.249
Hello, my dear.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.086
It's Spider-Man!

01:08:00.597 --> 01:08:02.557
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:08.397
Somebody help him!

01:08:08.605 --> 01:08:10.649
No!

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.193
Mommy!

01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:17.155
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.

01:08:17.739 --> 01:08:20.242
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

01:08:26.039 --> 01:08:27.291
Impressive!

01:08:51.565 --> 01:08:55.027
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

01:09:20.385 --> 01:09:21.428
Hold on!

01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.097
Watch out!

01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:37.027
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:25.200
Well, beats taking the subway.

01:10:25.409 --> 01:10:28.662
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:29.955
Wait!

01:10:30.122 --> 01:10:31.373
Who are you?

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.126
- You know who I am.
- I do?

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:36.962
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, mam.

01:10:48.682 --> 01:10:52.561
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:57.399
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. Im gona come over.

01:10:58.066 --> 01:10:59.735
No, I'm gonna come...

01:11:00.068 --> 01:11:03.488
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

01:11:03.697 --> 01:11:06.658
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

01:11:06.825 --> 01:11:09.119
...um I want to buy you something.

01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:12.623
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

01:11:13.665 --> 01:11:17.336
Okay..And what do you mean,
incredible?

01:11:20.172 --> 01:11:22.549
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

01:11:22.716 --> 01:11:24.468
Don't let the bedbugs...

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:33.185
She's all right.
She's..just a little rattled.

01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:38.523
Look, Peter, I should have
told you about us.

01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:42.527
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:45.739
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

01:11:46.823 --> 01:11:48.325
You're right.

01:11:49.242 --> 01:11:50.744
I didn't.

01:11:54.748 --> 01:11:57.167
I'm gonna get some rest.

01:11:58.418 --> 01:12:00.671
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

01:12:01.755 --> 01:12:03.507
What was that thing?

01:12:04.091 --> 01:12:05.425
I don't know.

01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:10.222
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

01:12:26.113 --> 01:12:27.281
Somebody there?

01:12:27.281 --> 01:12:30.075
Somebody.

01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.953
Who said that?

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.957
Don't play the innocent with me.

01:12:39.418 --> 01:12:42.087
You've known all along.

01:12:46.091 --> 01:12:47.467
Where are you?

01:12:47.634 --> 01:12:51.680
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

01:12:58.562 --> 01:13:00.397
I'm right here.

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:04.151
I don't understand.

01:13:05.152 --> 01:13:08.322
Did you think it was coincidence?

01:13:08.572 --> 01:13:12.117
So many good things,
all happening for you.

01:13:12.284 --> 01:13:15.954
All for you. Norman.

01:13:18.498 --> 01:13:19.916
What do you want?

01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:22.502
To say what you won't.

01:13:22.794 --> 01:13:25.339
To do what you can't.

01:13:25.505 --> 01:13:30.093
To remove those in your way.

01:13:34.056 --> 01:13:36.016
The board members.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.685
You killed them.

01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:40.395
We killed them.

01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:41.772
We?

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.523
Remember?

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:46.360
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

01:13:48.236 --> 01:13:50.030
The performance enhancers.

01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:55.494
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

01:13:55.702 --> 01:13:59.498
Bringing you
what you've always wanted

01:13:59.665 --> 01:14:02.542
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:05.212
And it's only the beginning..

01:14:06.713 --> 01:14:11.051
There's only one who can stop us.

01:14:11.843 --> 01:14:15.222
Or imagine if he joined us..hahaha..

01:14:20.018 --> 01:14:23.230
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.733
- The Green Goblin. You like that? Made it up myself.
- Mr. Jameson--

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.903
- These weirdos all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson...Spider-Man

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.738
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

01:14:32.948 --> 01:14:36.702
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.204
How about "Green Meanie"?

01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:42.249
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.

01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:44.751
It is not. I resent that.

01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:47.754
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:49.589
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.

01:14:50.048 --> 01:14:51.800
I trust my barber.

01:14:52.634 --> 01:14:54.136
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!

01:14:54.344 --> 01:14:59.099
Let him sue me. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:09.735
Jameson, you slime.

01:15:09.943 --> 01:15:13.238
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?

01:15:13.447 --> 01:15:16.366
- I don't know who he is. His stuff comes in the mail.
- Your lying!

01:15:16.533 --> 01:15:19.536
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

01:15:19.703 --> 01:15:22.623
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

01:15:22.831 --> 01:15:25.083
Set him down, tough guy.

01:15:25.334 --> 01:15:29.921
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.716
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will ya.

01:15:32.924 --> 01:15:35.385
Sleep...

01:15:49.858 --> 01:15:53.862
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

01:15:54.029 --> 01:15:58.450
No, you're not dead..yet.

01:15:58.659 --> 01:16:00.827
Just paralyzed...

01:16:00.994 --> 01:16:02.955
...temporarily.

01:16:03.956 --> 01:16:07.042
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.920
You and I are not so different.

01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:13.966
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

01:16:14.174 --> 01:16:17.052
Well, to each his own.

01:16:17.219 --> 01:16:20.180
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:25.477
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

01:16:25.686 --> 01:16:28.939
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

01:16:29.147 --> 01:16:32.734
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:37.447
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

01:16:37.656 --> 01:16:38.699
Why bother?

01:16:38.907 --> 01:16:43.620
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

01:16:44.037 --> 01:16:47.040
There are eight million people
in this city.

01:16:47.249 --> 01:16:51.545
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

01:16:51.753 --> 01:16:55.716
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

01:16:55.882 --> 01:16:57.301
You, me...

01:16:57.884 --> 01:16:59.803
...we're exceptional.

01:17:00.053 --> 01:17:04.725
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

01:17:04.933 --> 01:17:08.604
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:12.357
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

01:17:12.566 --> 01:17:15.319
What we could create.

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:17.904
Or we could destroy!

01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:22.034
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

01:17:22.242 --> 01:17:27.122
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

01:17:29.124 --> 01:17:32.002
Think about it, hero.

01:17:43.972 --> 01:17:49.311
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

01:17:59.655 --> 01:18:01.114
Hey! It's me again.

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.908
- Hey!
- How was your audition?

01:18:03.116 --> 01:18:06.119
- How did you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

01:18:06.286 --> 01:18:08.246
...told my aunt, told me.

01:18:08.705 --> 01:18:10.040
So you just came by?

01:18:10.248 --> 01:18:13.877
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

01:18:14.044 --> 01:18:18.632
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:20.384
So how'd it go?

01:18:22.552 --> 01:18:25.138
Well..They said I needed acting lessons.

01:18:25.305 --> 01:18:29.059
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:34.564
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

01:18:35.899 --> 01:18:37.985
I'd like a cheeseburger.

01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:41.905
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

01:18:42.322 --> 01:18:43.740
Come with us.

01:18:43.907 --> 01:18:46.660
No thanks. How's it going with?

01:18:48.578 --> 01:18:51.081
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

01:18:51.581 --> 01:18:53.083
It's not?

01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:56.169
Why so interested?

01:18:56.837 --> 01:18:58.338
I'm not.

01:18:58.588 --> 01:18:59.965
You're not?

01:19:01.591 --> 01:19:04.344
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

01:19:04.594 --> 01:19:06.388
Why would you be?

01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:10.601
I, that's a...

01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:12.311
I don't know.

01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:17.357
Sorry you won't come with us.

01:19:19.818 --> 01:19:21.778
I'd better run, tiger.

01:19:30.495 --> 01:19:32.497
Hey, check it out, man.

01:19:32.664 --> 01:19:34.333
Come on, man.

01:19:37.878 --> 01:19:41.131
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

01:19:59.024 --> 01:20:00.484
Get off me!

01:20:33.767 --> 01:20:35.269
Wait!

01:20:40.107 --> 01:20:42.484
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

01:20:42.651 --> 01:20:47.030
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

01:20:47.239 --> 01:20:49.116
I was in the neighborhood.

01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:53.620
You are amazing.

01:20:54.579 --> 01:20:57.291
Some people don't think so.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:01.378
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

01:21:02.129 --> 01:21:05.340
Do I get to say thank you this time?

01:21:06.216 --> 01:21:07.718
Wait.

01:22:16.703 --> 01:22:18.830
I have to get in there!!
My baby's in there!! My baby's in there!!

01:22:18.997 --> 01:22:21.124
- Let me go!! My baby!!!
- I can't let you in there! The roof's about to collapse!

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:24.795
- Somebody save my baby!!
- The roof's about to collapse!

01:22:25.003 --> 01:22:26.338
Look! Up there!

01:22:32.928 --> 01:22:34.763
Save my baby, please!!

01:22:58.495 --> 01:22:59.621
No!!!

01:23:07.379 --> 01:23:11.383
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

01:23:12.426 --> 01:23:15.345
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

01:23:15.554 --> 01:23:17.306
Don't let him get away!

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:20.767
There he is! Don't let him get away!Hold it! Hold it
right there! You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

01:23:20.934 --> 01:23:24.271
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

01:23:25.731 --> 01:23:27.065
I'm going.

01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:31.778
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.

01:23:32.195 --> 01:23:33.322
Go! Go!

01:23:42.247 --> 01:23:43.957
- Where are you?
- (Torturous Screaming)

01:23:46.001 --> 01:23:47.586
Where are you?!

01:23:52.966 --> 01:23:55.344
I'm gonna get you out of here!

01:23:57.929 --> 01:23:59.431
It's okay.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.066
You're pathetically predictable.

01:24:09.232 --> 01:24:11.151
Like a moth to the flame.

01:24:12.027 --> 01:24:14.488
What about my generous proposal?

01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:18.367
Are you in or are you out?

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:24.498
- It's you who's out, Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

01:24:24.915 --> 01:24:26.416
Oh, great..

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.874
No one says no to me!

01:25:15.215 --> 01:25:18.635
- M.J., can you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

01:25:21.138 --> 01:25:22.389
He's here.

01:25:23.181 --> 01:25:24.683
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:25:26.518 --> 01:25:29.187
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

01:25:29.396 --> 01:25:32.482
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

01:25:32.691 --> 01:25:36.111
- Why Thank you, Mr. Osborn. We're so glad you could come.
- You look great (Harry) - Thanks (MJ)

01:25:36.361 --> 01:25:39.072
Who is this lovely young lady?

01:25:39.239 --> 01:25:43.535
- MJ, I'd like you to meet my father. Norman Osborn
- Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
- Hi

01:25:43.744 --> 01:25:46.413
How do you do? I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

01:25:46.622 --> 01:25:50.334
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.878
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

01:25:58.634 --> 01:26:02.220
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

01:26:05.223 --> 01:26:06.725
Peter?

01:26:14.775 --> 01:26:16.485
Peter? Is that you?

01:26:21.949 --> 01:26:26.119
How strange. There's nobody here.

01:26:32.584 --> 01:26:37.047
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

01:27:09.663 --> 01:27:12.291
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

01:27:12.457 --> 01:27:14.209
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.

01:27:14.376 --> 01:27:18.297
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:21.591
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

01:27:21.758 --> 01:27:23.343
...and we can say grace.

01:27:26.888 --> 01:27:28.640
Here we go.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:37.941
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

01:27:41.737 --> 01:27:44.031
Will you do the honors?

01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:58.962
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

01:28:01.798 --> 01:28:07.137
Oh..yeah..I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

01:28:07.304 --> 01:28:08.847
Well, let me see.

01:28:09.056 --> 01:28:10.557
Oh, my goodness.

01:28:10.807 --> 01:28:13.226
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

01:28:13.393 --> 01:28:16.521
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:22.027
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment, and we are going
do things properly.

01:28:22.986 --> 01:28:26.073
How did you say that happened?

01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:28.200
Bike messenger.

01:28:28.408 --> 01:28:30.369
Knocked me down.

01:28:35.749 --> 01:28:39.419
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- What? Why?

01:28:40.337 --> 01:28:43.715
Something has come to my attention.

01:28:43.924 --> 01:28:45.175
Are you all right?

01:28:45.384 --> 01:28:48.887
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

01:28:49.513 --> 01:28:51.890
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad! Dad!

01:28:54.059 --> 01:28:57.854
What are you doing? I planned this whole thing
so you could meet M.J, and now you have to leave?

01:28:58.063 --> 01:28:59.731
I gotta go.

01:29:00.065 --> 01:29:04.194
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

01:29:04.403 --> 01:29:08.365
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

01:29:08.615 --> 01:29:11.618
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

01:29:11.785 --> 01:29:17.207
They're all beautiful, until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

01:29:17.416 --> 01:29:18.667
You're wrong about her Dad.

01:29:19.209 --> 01:29:22.421
A word to the not so wise
about your little girlfriend,

01:29:22.587 --> 01:29:26.466
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

01:29:36.852 --> 01:29:39.396
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

01:29:39.605 --> 01:29:42.566
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

01:29:42.774 --> 01:29:46.653
That creep is my father!
If I'm lucky, I'll become half of what he is

01:29:46.903 --> 01:29:49.239
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand!

01:29:49.406 --> 01:29:51.074
Harry Osborn!l

01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:54.202
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

01:29:57.164 --> 01:30:00.500
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

01:30:00.667 --> 01:30:03.795
But Parker, we can destroy him.

01:30:04.004 --> 01:30:05.339
I can't.

01:30:05.505 --> 01:30:08.508
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

01:30:08.759 --> 01:30:11.011
Parker must be educated.

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.473
What do I do?

01:30:14.681 --> 01:30:18.769
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

01:30:18.936 --> 01:30:21.980
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:23.523
Yes?

01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:25.609
And then grant his wish.

01:30:26.526 --> 01:30:27.819
But how?

01:30:28.028 --> 01:30:32.324
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

01:30:32.532 --> 01:30:33.700
Tell me how!

01:30:33.867 --> 01:30:36.036
The heart, Osborn.

01:30:36.286 --> 01:30:39.331
First, we attack his heart.

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:44.711
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.881
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:30:48.131 --> 01:30:51.969
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

01:30:59.726 --> 01:31:02.271
Deliver us!

01:31:02.479 --> 01:31:03.855
Finish it!

01:31:04.147 --> 01:31:08.068
- Finish it!
- From evil!

01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:15.951
Two milligrams IV.

01:31:17.744 --> 01:31:18.996
Get the BP.

01:31:19.413 --> 01:31:23.000
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:24.543
You have to leave.

01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:26.420
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

01:31:26.586 --> 01:31:30.674
Those horrible yellow eyes!

01:31:35.512 --> 01:31:38.056
He knows who I am.

01:32:22.017 --> 01:32:23.602
I'm sorry.

01:32:27.314 --> 01:32:29.775
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

01:32:29.942 --> 01:32:32.611
She's been sleeping all day.

01:32:33.612 --> 01:32:36.365
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

01:32:40.535 --> 01:32:43.455
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

01:32:43.622 --> 01:32:47.334
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

01:32:47.542 --> 01:32:50.504
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

01:32:50.963 --> 01:32:53.131
I haven't called him back.

01:32:55.217 --> 01:32:56.927
The fact is...

01:32:58.095 --> 01:33:00.931
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

01:33:01.098 --> 01:33:03.308
At least I think I am.

01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:08.021
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

01:33:08.188 --> 01:33:11.441
Would I know his name, this guy?

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.528
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

01:33:14.695 --> 01:33:16.071
Trust me.

01:33:16.321 --> 01:33:17.572
It's funny.

01:33:19.574 --> 01:33:23.537
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

01:33:23.704 --> 01:33:27.082
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

01:33:27.291 --> 01:33:30.252
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:34.756
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

01:33:34.923 --> 01:33:37.843
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:39.678
I know him a little bit.

01:33:39.886 --> 01:33:42.764
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

01:33:42.973 --> 01:33:46.101
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

01:33:46.435 --> 01:33:47.894
What'd he say?

01:33:48.478 --> 01:33:49.813
I said...

01:33:50.897 --> 01:33:55.193
He asked me what I thought about you.

01:33:56.111 --> 01:33:58.155
And what did you say?

01:33:58.864 --> 01:34:02.951
I said umm, "Spider-Man."

01:34:03.285 --> 01:34:08.165
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

01:34:08.373 --> 01:34:09.916
...is...

01:34:10.834 --> 01:34:14.087
...when you look in her eyes...

01:34:16.632 --> 01:34:19.843
...and she's looking back in yours...

01:34:20.844 --> 01:34:23.847
...everything feels...

01:34:25.057 --> 01:34:26.892
...not quite normal.

01:34:28.143 --> 01:34:29.937
Because you feel...

01:34:30.479 --> 01:34:32.105
...stronger...

01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:37.277
...and weaker at the same time.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.447
You feel excited...

01:34:41.323 --> 01:34:43.367
...and at the same time...

01:34:43.992 --> 01:34:45.619
...terrified.

01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:52.250
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:57.297
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

01:35:00.008 --> 01:35:01.885
It's as if you've...

01:35:02.511 --> 01:35:05.681
...reached the unreachable...

01:35:07.265 --> 01:35:09.977
...and you weren't ready for it."

01:35:13.438 --> 01:35:15.190
You said that?

01:35:15.983 --> 01:35:18.318
Well, something like that.

01:36:02.613 --> 01:36:04.114
Dad?

01:36:09.453 --> 01:36:11.538
Dad, is that you?

01:36:18.128 --> 01:36:19.630
What is it?

01:36:21.882 --> 01:36:26.887
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

01:36:27.888 --> 01:36:30.599
She's in love with Peter.

01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:32.684
- Parker?
- Yeah.

01:36:32.851 --> 01:36:35.979
And how does he feel about her?

01:36:37.397 --> 01:36:39.942
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:46.156
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

01:36:49.076 --> 01:36:50.827
I'm so sorry.

01:36:53.288 --> 01:36:56.750
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

01:36:58.502 --> 01:37:01.713
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.715
That's no excuse.

01:37:04.716 --> 01:37:06.510
I'm proud of you.

01:37:07.052 --> 01:37:11.932
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But Im gona make it up to you.

01:37:12.099 --> 01:37:15.352
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

01:37:29.491 --> 01:37:31.285
Wake up, little spider.

01:37:31.451 --> 01:37:32.953
Wake up.

01:37:34.288 --> 01:37:35.872
Go home, dear.

01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:37.416
You look awful.

01:37:37.624 --> 01:37:39.918
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

01:37:40.085 --> 01:37:43.422
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

01:37:43.588 --> 01:37:46.300
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

01:37:46.466 --> 01:37:52.014
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

01:37:52.764 --> 01:37:54.516
A smile. Finally.

01:37:54.683 --> 01:37:59.021
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

01:37:59.187 --> 01:38:01.481
You were supposed to be asleep.

01:38:02.316 --> 01:38:07.070
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

01:38:07.279 --> 01:38:11.283
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:17.748
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an angel?"

01:38:17.956 --> 01:38:21.501
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:26.923
Well, Harry's in love with her.

01:38:27.132 --> 01:38:30.886
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

01:38:31.094 --> 01:38:35.682
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

01:38:35.891 --> 01:38:39.019
You're so mysterious all the time.

01:38:39.269 --> 01:38:42.022
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:46.193
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

01:38:46.652 --> 01:38:49.071
Everybody else knows.

01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:53.283
I'll be right back.

01:38:53.992 --> 01:38:55.285
But...

01:39:02.626 --> 01:39:04.628
Come on, pick up.

01:39:04.795 --> 01:39:08.090
- Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.

01:39:09.132 --> 01:39:11.176
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

01:39:11.468 --> 01:39:14.304
Hello? You there?

01:39:14.805 --> 01:39:19.309
Well, I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

01:39:19.476 --> 01:39:20.894
All right, well...

01:39:21.311 --> 01:39:22.354
Don't...

01:39:23.146 --> 01:39:25.357
Don't go up any dark alleys.

01:39:25.565 --> 01:39:27.067
Hello?

01:39:29.486 --> 01:39:33.198
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

01:39:33.407 --> 01:39:35.158
Where is she?

01:40:21.413 --> 01:40:23.081
- What is that?
- That's cool!

01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:27.919
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

01:40:28.086 --> 01:40:32.257
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

01:40:49.066 --> 01:40:50.817
Goblin, what have you done?

01:41:33.277 --> 01:41:37.155
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

01:41:37.531 --> 01:41:39.199
Because you never know...

01:41:39.366 --> 01:41:44.121
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

01:41:45.247 --> 01:41:47.874
Let die the woman you love...

01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:57.259
...or suffer the little children.

01:41:59.636 --> 01:42:02.139
- Spider-Man!
- Save us! Save Us!

01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:04.933
Save us! Save Us!

01:42:05.225 --> 01:42:07.811
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.398
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

01:42:11.565 --> 01:42:13.650
Don't do it, Goblin!

01:42:13.817 --> 01:42:16.737
We are who we choose to be.

01:42:16.987 --> 01:42:19.740
- Now, choose!
- No!

01:42:48.435 --> 01:42:50.020
Everybody stay still!

01:42:59.529 --> 01:43:00.822
Ahoy up there!

01:43:00.989 --> 01:43:03.951
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

01:43:11.458 --> 01:43:15.587
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

01:43:15.754 --> 01:43:17.255
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

01:43:22.344 --> 01:43:25.389
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

01:43:25.555 --> 01:43:27.140
Trust me.

01:43:28.642 --> 01:43:32.479
Hold on tight and go quickly.

01:43:36.817 --> 01:43:38.860
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

01:43:39.069 --> 01:43:40.737
Hang on, Mary Jane!

01:44:09.182 --> 01:44:11.810
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

01:44:21.695 --> 01:44:24.906
It's time to die.

01:44:31.913 --> 01:44:35.751
- Come on up here joker! I got a lil something for you!
- We ought to kick your freakin ass!

01:44:35.917 --> 01:44:39.338
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You gotta pick on a guy trying to
save a bunch of kids?

01:44:40.005 --> 01:44:43.508
I got something for yo ass!
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

01:44:43.675 --> 01:44:47.220
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

01:44:59.733 --> 01:45:01.526
Spider-Man, watch out!

01:45:33.392 --> 01:45:37.646
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

01:45:38.563 --> 01:45:41.191
I offered you friendship...

01:45:41.358 --> 01:45:43.235
...and you spat in my face.

01:46:34.328 --> 01:46:37.998
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

01:46:38.165 --> 01:46:41.501
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

01:46:41.668 --> 01:46:43.337
...would have been quick and painless.

01:46:43.503 --> 01:46:46.923
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

01:46:47.174 --> 01:46:52.054
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow..

01:46:56.642 --> 01:46:58.685
M.J. and I...

01:46:59.519 --> 01:47:02.814
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

01:47:56.618 --> 01:47:58.161
Peter, stop!

01:47:58.328 --> 01:48:00.789
Stop! It's me.

01:48:09.756 --> 01:48:11.258
Mr. Osborn.

01:48:11.425 --> 01:48:12.968
Peter, Thank God for you.

01:48:13.176 --> 01:48:15.512
You killed those people
on that balcony.

01:48:15.679 --> 01:48:18.724
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:20.642
Don't let him take me again.

01:48:20.809 --> 01:48:22.853
I beg you. Protect me.

01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.607
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

01:48:26.773 --> 01:48:28.275
But not you.

01:48:28.942 --> 01:48:32.904
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

01:48:33.113 --> 01:48:35.198
I would never hurt you.

01:48:35.407 --> 01:48:37.326
I knew from the beginning...

01:48:37.534 --> 01:48:40.454
...if anything ever happened to me...

01:48:40.621 --> 01:48:42.748
...it was you I could count on.

01:48:42.914 --> 01:48:46.293
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

01:48:46.877 --> 01:48:48.712
Thank God for you.

01:48:49.713 --> 01:48:51.131
Give me your hand.

01:48:52.299 --> 01:48:55.719
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

01:48:57.137 --> 01:48:59.931
I've been like a father to you.

01:49:01.475 --> 01:49:03.143
Be a son to me now.

01:49:04.937 --> 01:49:06.813
I have a father.

01:49:07.564 --> 01:49:10.067
His name was Ben Parker.

01:49:11.944 --> 01:49:13.403
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

01:49:32.339 --> 01:49:33.840
Peter.

01:49:36.176 --> 01:49:38.011
Peter..Don't tell Harry.

01:50:09.710 --> 01:50:11.420
What have you done?

01:50:11.586 --> 01:50:13.171
What have you done?!

01:50:41.325 --> 01:50:43.368
Hey..I'm so sorry, Harry.

01:50:44.286 --> 01:50:47.414
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

01:50:49.583 --> 01:50:52.878
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

01:50:54.463 --> 01:50:56.757
One day Spider-Man will pay.

01:50:58.634 --> 01:51:01.762
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

01:51:06.767 --> 01:51:08.602
Thank God for you, Peter.

01:51:09.311 --> 01:51:11.772
You're the only family I have.

01:51:36.296 --> 01:51:38.590
No matter what I do...

01:51:38.757 --> 01:51:41.885
...no matter how hard I try...

01:51:42.469 --> 01:51:46.306
...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

01:51:57.025 --> 01:51:59.361
You must miss him so much.

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.365
It's been so hard without him.

01:52:06.285 --> 01:52:09.162
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

01:52:10.956 --> 01:52:12.749
When I was up there...

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.295
...and I thought I was gonna die...

01:52:17.921 --> 01:52:21.758
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

01:52:23.051 --> 01:52:26.263
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

01:52:27.723 --> 01:52:30.142
It was you, Pete.

01:52:31.018 --> 01:52:32.894
I kept thinking:

01:52:33.312 --> 01:52:36.106
"I hope I make it through this...

01:52:37.566 --> 01:52:41.945
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

01:52:43.322 --> 01:52:44.823
Really?

01:52:45.198 --> 01:52:50.996
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

01:52:52.247 --> 01:52:54.207
...who makes me feel...

01:52:54.666 --> 01:52:58.378
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

01:53:00.505 --> 01:53:02.174
That I'm just...

01:53:02.841 --> 01:53:04.343
...me.

01:53:05.427 --> 01:53:07.346
And that's okay.

01:53:09.556 --> 01:53:11.016
The truth is...

01:53:13.143 --> 01:53:14.937
...I love you.

01:53:17.064 --> 01:53:18.982
I love you so much, Peter.

01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:44.466
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

01:53:44.633 --> 01:53:46.551
I can't...

01:53:48.679 --> 01:53:50.222
You can't what?

01:53:51.348 --> 01:53:52.808
Tell you...

01:53:54.518 --> 01:53:58.855
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:03.860
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

01:54:04.778 --> 01:54:06.738
I want you to know...

01:54:07.155 --> 01:54:09.825
...that I will always be there
for you.

01:54:10.033 --> 01:54:13.996
I will always be there
to take care of you.

01:54:14.997 --> 01:54:16.999
I promise you that.

01:54:20.294 --> 01:54:22.587
I will always be your friend.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.380
Only a friend...

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.800
...Peter Parker?

01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:34.810
That's all I have to give.

01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:03.840
Whatever life holds in store for me...

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.880
...I will never forget these words:

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:12.135
"With great power
comes great responsibility."

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:14.550
This is my gift.

01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.850
My curse.

01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:19.270
Who am I?

01:55:19.645 --> 01:55:21.000
I'm Spider-Man.
